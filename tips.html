                    <h2>Boston Shaker vs. Cobbler Shaker vs. French Shaker: The Main Differences</h2>
                    <p>Cocktail shakers, essential tools in any bartender's kit, come in various styles, each with unique attributes and historical backgrounds. The Boston Shaker, available in two variants—glass-on-tin and tin-on-tin—is preferred for its durability and efficiency, especially in busy bars. The glass-on-tin style offers a visual appeal during mixing but is prone to breaking, whereas the all-metal tin-on-tin version provides a robust alternative, maintaining colder temperatures due to better thermal properties and is less likely to shatter. In contrast, the Cobbler Shaker, which debuted in 1884 and named after a popular cocktail style, features a three-piece design including a built-in strainer. While iconic, its design can be cumbersome during busy shifts, often requiring a secondary strainer to catch finer particles. The Parisian Shaker, or French Shaker, strikes a balance between the Cobbler and Boston styles, offering aesthetic appeal and functional design without a built-in strainer, making it less ideal for high-volume settings but a stylish option for home bars. Each shaker type offers distinct advantages depending on the setting and the bartender's needs, whether prioritizing efficiency, style, or a mix of both.</p>

                <h2>What's the Best Martini Glass?</h2>
                <p>Al Sotack, a Brooklyn bar owner, prefers the coupe glass for its aesthetic and ergonomic qualities. The coupe, originally used for Champagne in the 1830s, has a storied history in cocktail culture. The classic V-shaped Martini glass, popularized in the 1920s, is iconic but criticized by some bartenders for its impractical design that is prone to spillage. The Nick & Nora glass, revived in the 1980s by Dale DeGroff, is favored for its elegant, spill-resistant design. Overall, there's a diversity of opinions on the best glass for a Martini, reflecting broader trends in bar culture and personal preference among bartenders.</p>

                    <h2>The 8 Best Jiggers of 2024, According to Pro Bartenders</h2>
                    <p>The Cocktail Kingdom Leopold Jigger is recognized as the best overall for its weighted feel and various finishes, though its copper-plated option isn't dishwasher-safe. For value, the OXO Steel Angled Measuring Jigger offers a cost-effective, versatile choice with clear markings, albeit less attractive. The most luxurious option, the Match Pewter Jigger, features handcrafted design but is expensive and requires hand-washing. Beginners might prefer the Barfly Japanese-Style Jigger, which is affordable, dishwasher-safe, and aesthetically pleasing, though somewhat lightweight. The Piña Barware Slim Stainless Steel Jigger is the top Japanese pick, praised for its accuracy and comfort but with slightly hard-to-read exterior markings. The True Trio Multi Unit Measured Jigger stands out for its ergonomic design and clarity in measurements, though it is a bit pricier. The Cocktail Kingdom's Japanese-Style Jigger is celebrated for its durability and balanced feel, yet it also requires hand-washing. Lastly, the Yukiwa Stainless Steel Seamless Jigger wins for best design, offering elegance and ease of use, though it lacks measurement markings.</p>
